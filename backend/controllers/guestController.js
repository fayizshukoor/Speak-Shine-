const TRANSCRIPTIONS = [
  "Good morning everyone. Today I want to talk about a very challenging decision I had to make last year. I was given a choice between two job offers — one was a safe, comfortable position close to home, and the other was a risky startup in a new city. I chose the startup because I believe that growth happens outside your comfort zone. It was not easy at first, but the experience taught me resilience and adaptability. I used the word resilience to describe how I bounced back from setbacks during this journey.",
  "Hello, I would like to speak about my mentor, Mr. Kumar, who was my college professor. He always told me that communication is the most powerful skill a person can develop. His guidance helped me become more articulate and confident in expressing my thoughts. He persevered through every challenge with a smile, and that inspired me deeply. I try to follow his example every single day in my personal and professional life.",
  "What motivates me every morning is the thought of becoming a better version of myself. I wake up with a clear goal — to improve at least one skill today. Whether it is public speaking, reading, or physical fitness, I am always looking to grow. I practice articulating my ideas clearly so that when I speak, people listen. Consistency and discipline are what drive me forward each and every day.",
  "My dream career is to become a business communication trainer who helps young professionals speak with confidence. I am deeply passionate about English speaking and personal development. I want to create a world where everyone, regardless of their background, can express themselves clearly and powerfully. Every day I work towards this goal by practicing my speaking skills and learning from the best communicators around me.",
  "Handling pressure at work requires resilience and a clear mind. I have developed a system where I prioritize tasks, focus on what I can control, and let go of what I cannot. When deadlines are tight, I break the work into smaller steps and tackle them one by one. I have also learned that asking for help is not a weakness — it is a sign of wisdom. My team always performs better when we communicate openly and honestly.",
  "The book that changed my perspective the most is 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. It taught me that our daily habits shape our identity. After reading it, I started waking up one hour earlier every day to practice my English speaking skills. The perseverance required to maintain this habit has transformed not just my communication skills but my entire approach to life. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to grow.",
